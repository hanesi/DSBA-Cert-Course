Probability and Distributions

Going to look at mathematical distributions of data

Probability refers to likelihood of an event taking place
event is an outcome
experiment is a process performed to understand outcomes
set of outcomes is called a sample space

Sample space consists of events, it's where we do experiments

probability refers to outcomes and events

three parts from a manufacturing unit are selected, determine if defective or not
determine:
sample space
event of getting at least 2 defective parts

Let S be sample space { GGG, GGD, GDG, DGG, GDD, DGD, DDG, DDD}
Let E denote event of at least 2 defectives {GDD, DGD, DDG, DDD}
and use E

Probability = m/n (number of ways it could happen/total number of outcomes)
probability is always >= 0 and =< 1

1 == it will happen 0 == it wont

Mutual Exclusivity - two events with nothing in common between them
  if one happens, the other wont. If you pick a card from a deck, it is a king or queen
  not both

Independent events - A and B events are not influenced by each other
  ME events are not independent. If you know one event happened, you know other did not
  i.e. drew a king so know you didnt draw a queen

Can add probabilities if they are ME (A union B)
  A or B or both = A+B

If there is a commonality between events, it's A + B - A intersection B

if ME, intersection of A and B is 0 (cannot both happen)

Well shuffled cards, picked at random
Probability of King or Queen?
  8/52 (Chance of king plus chance of Queen)
Probability of King or Diamond?
  4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52
  (chance of king plus chance of diamond minus chance of diamond king)

Independent events - Multiplication rule
Chance of A and B equals chance of A x B
  (if 50/50, chance of both is 25%)

Chance of getting an A in Math and Marketing, multiply both probabilities

When not independent, chance of A and B is the chance of A and then B given A

2 cards drawn in succession, probability of drawing back to back spades?
13/52 x 12/51 = 156/2652 = 1/17

Marginal probability

200 families surveyed, relating income to propensity to buy car
  arrage data as a table (contingency table)
  divide into 4 segments, income above or below 20k, buyer or not buyer

  |Family|income above|income below|total|
  ----------------------------------------
  |buyer |38          |42          |80   |
  |not   |82          |38          |120  |
  |Total |120         |80          |200  |

  Probability a selected family buys is 80/200 40%, marginal probability (refers to a total count)
  Both buying and above income? refers to 42 people, 42/200 .21% (joint probability, refers to interior count)
  Random family of income above, what are the odds they buy a car?
    42/80 52.5%, conditional probability (42 above bought, 80 total bought)

Bayes' Theorem

Extension of conditional Probability

there is a hypothesis (patient may have disease) to validate, evidence is gathered
  evaluate hypothesis given evidence

  Big deal in ML

P(H|E) = P(E|H)/(P(E)) * P(H)

Example - Spam filtering

Email identified as spam, individual may not want this message. How to identify it?

Consider words in it.

Pr(spam|words) = (PR(words|spam) * Pr(spam)) / Pr(words)

given a word, what's the likelihood that it's spam? can then set a threshold as you see fit

Distribution - collection of probabilities
  come in various size/shape/color

Binomial dist - distribution of counts (tossing coins, how many heads/tails)
  used for a discrete random variable

Bernoulli Process - independently random trials, like flipping coins
  probability of success is the same, outcomes don't influence each other

  Basically n!/(x!(n-x)!) where x = number of success in n trials

Bank looking at accounts, 60% chance they pay bills on time
Whats the chance 2 accounts pay on time in a set of 7?

(7/2) (6^2)(5^2)

Has a mean, np
StDev = sqrt(np(1-p))

Poisson Distribution
Plays a role in quality control, i.e. number of cars through checkpoint per hour
  or number of corrupted pixels in an image

  Hard to give a boolean outcome, applies to counts only really

P(x) = (e^-lambda * lambda^x) / x!
  lambda is average number of counts expected to see

understand mailicious attacks on computer, average successes = 3, see 1 attack per day

e^-3 * 3^1 / 11

If 6 customers show up every 2 minutes to a bank, what is the chance 4 show up in
  one minute?

  lambda = 3 per min
  x = 4 customers
  e^-3 * 3^4 / 4!

Normal Distribution
Continuous values, bell curve, etc

StDev is a spread +/- 1 StDev contains 68% of the data
In data terms, if it's normally distributed, 2/3 of it fall 1 StDev from the mean

+/- 2 contains 95%, +/- 3 contains 99.7%

never goes to 0, bell shaped, centered around mean, has mean and StDev

z score = take value, subtract mean, divide by StDev

what is distribution of cereal. mean of 0.295 kg, 0.025kg stdev

less than .280kg? P(x < .0280) = P (x - .295) / 0.025 -> -0.6
