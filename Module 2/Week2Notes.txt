Hypothesis testing

Concepts of sampling distributions

analyze data to make inferences about large subset of data
sample stat vs population parameter
sampling distribution is the dist of a stat that can be drawn from a population

CLT - central limit theorem
allows us to assume data from pop when large enough follows a pattern

have a pop with mean and stdev (mu, rho)
want to see if sampling dist follows normal dist and if it has a mu and rho
  standard mean has an error, what is it?
    the error present because it came from a sample

sample has mean mu and stdev rho over sqrt(n) -> c/a
as pop gets bigger, stdev drops

if pop is normal, smaller samples will be
if not, you can still make this calculation but now have a z transformation
z = stdev - rho / c/a
if population is huge, this is approximately normal

sample mean is approx normal, applies to discrete and continuous dists
number of kids isnt a fraction, but a dist is
must be random sample, independent, sample should be no more than 10% pop
  sample size of 30 is considered enough z is about nromal if n > 30

make normality assumption when convenient


Hypothesis

assumption made independent of data
null Hypothesis - status quo, reject leads to desired conclusion
alternate Hypothesis - what someone wants to be true

Hypothesis formulation

coke promises 600ml in a bottle of coke, is it tho?
need sufficient evidence, without it, we assume null hypothesis

generate a sample
calculate mean
test the status quo, is mean == 600ml?
if you can prove that it's not theres a problem
what status quo am i testing? or am i testing an assumption i dont know yet?
equality sign goes with null hypothesis

conclusions we draw are made with respect to the null Hypothesis
either reject or not. its boolean

if we fail to reject, doesn't mean null hypothesis is true, just means it
  wasnt disproven

Type 1 and Type 2 errors

reject null when false - correct
fail to reject when its right - correct
reject null when true - Type 1 Error (alpha)
fail to reject when false - Type 2 error (beta)

confidence level = 1 - alpha
want to be 95% confident

power of the test = 1 - beta

maximize power of test for fixed alpha, this makes good hypothesis tests

Hypothesis testing roadmap

categorical data - take samples (1 or 2 proportion test)
continuous data - population known or unknown test (z test/T test)

Steps in testing

develop a clear problem
establish null and alt Hypothesis
determine confidence level
state decision when to reject or accept
gather data
calculate stats
state conclusion based on p value
make inference

if P is low, Null will go!

type of hypothesis tests

single sample, multiple, one or two tailed, mean, variance, proportions, etc

One tailed or two tailed
mean vol isnt equal to 600ml
  prove that something is not equal to 600
  Ha is that avg is not 600
  Ho is that it is 600
  This makes it two tailed

mean vol is more than 600
  Ha is more than 600
  Ho is less or equal to 600
  Makes it one tailed

purpose is to get a stat, say is it too large or small

say we will reject if avg is not 600, but we wont get exactly 600. what do we accept?

two tailed means there is a too large and too small.
test tells us cutoffs, but its not convenient
  measure the average so it becomes standardized
  measure xbar - 600
  What makes it large? let the data speak with a standard error
    standard error is c/a

define parameter
define stat
normalize stat
invoke CLT

One tailed is the same, but we are only looking at one direction.
something will only be more than 600ml

Confidence Interval

can i put +/- around mean and say these are the good ones
What values are supported by the data?

if sample mean is in the white, reject null hyopthesis
95% confidence statement says 95% of data is in it

paper
mean length = 11 inches
stdev = 0.02 inches
100 pieces drawn at random

10.998 +/- 1.96 * 0.02/sqrt(100) for 95%

A random sample of 100 men is taken and their mean height is found to be 180 cm.
The population variance is 36 cm2. Find the 95% confidence interval
(Z alpha/2 = 1.96) for the mean height of the population(μ).

Sample mean  = 180 cm
Sample size (n)  = 100
Standard deviation = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(36) = 6
The standard error (σ/ sqrt(n))  = 6 / sqrt(100) =  0.6.

Lower limit: 180  - 1.96 * 0.6  = 178.824
Upper limit: 180 + 1.96 * 0.6 = 181.176
So 95% for μ is given by 178.824, 181.176

Single sample z test of mean (known as rho)

has waiting time changed from 4.5 mins
stdev is 1.2
sample mean is 5.1
25 sampled

is it stat sig?

use one sided test, is it more or not?

z = 5.1 - 4.5 / 1.2/sqrt25 = 2.5

5.1 minutes is 2.5 StDevs above 4.5

larger than 2.36, reject null Ha mu > 4.5

one tail or two tail, determine null and Ha,
determine Z
compare to normal curve
reject Null or not

Test of mean

replace sigma with s, sample StDev
cant use normal dist anymore tho
look at t statistic/distribution
similar to normal but a little more spread out
if sample becomes large, s becomes approximately sigma, use normal dist

testing two samples, do they represent 2 different populations?
if rho is known use z dist
if not use t dist

2 tests, compressive strength of concrete after 2 and 7 days
