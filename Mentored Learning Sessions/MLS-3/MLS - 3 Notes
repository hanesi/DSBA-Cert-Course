MLS - 3 Notes

Mode can't be applied on continuous data, but discrete values, yes

Descriptive stats help with summarization, graphs/charts/tables
Inferential stats - extract predictions about a population from a sample

Continuous stats - height, can have any possible value (decimals)
Discrete - family size, can't have 2.5 family members (integers)

Qualitative data  - Nominal (male/female) or Ordinal (happy, sad)
Quantitative - Discrete/Continuous (see above)

Population - universe of possible data for an object
Parameter - numerical value associated with a Population
Sample - selection of observations from population
Statistic - numerical value from a Sample

ex:
Population - all target customers
Sample - Random group of 200 who visited the store during the blind test
Parameter - acceptance rate of the product
Statistic - acceptance rate of the product from the random 200 people

Dispersion - how large the spread of distribution is
Range - difference between max and min value
Interquartile Range - Measure of variability, divide data into quartiles, Q1 - Q3

Variance - How far each value varies from the mean
Standard Deviation - How spread out the numbers are

Covariance - measure of association between two values
  association in units of the two vars
Correlation - Is the same, but dimensionless, can compare beyond units
